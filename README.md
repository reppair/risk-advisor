## Outro
I decided to follow KISS principle and toy around with Inertia for the first time instead of data modeling. It feels
good building with Inertia, although I just barely touched the surface of it today. I've been doing a lot of Livewire
last few years so my Vue is a bit rusty, so I went with what I know - options API, but I got my eyes on the composition
API - I'll be learning it.

Anyway, I started at 19:45 today, now it is 2:25 so that is what, 6.5 hours? Yeah... that is with several interruptions
after a 12 hours work day today, prior starting this task so not my best turn around time, nor it is a masterpiece,
but it will do just fine for a demo I think.

Cheers!
It has been a pleasure!
